# FixWeed

A free, ad-free webapp for people struggling with weed addiction or moderation.

## Mission

Quitting weed should be easy. If it isn't, you shouldn't have to pay to make it easy.

FixWeed helps you understand your usage patterns—all without paywalls or subscription fees.

## Core Method

**Profile-Based Insights**: Answer a few questions about your habits, and see your patterns laid out clearly. No judgment for your patterns. No shame for being honest. Just data.

The belief is straightforward: awareness drives change. By visualizing your usage details, understanding becomes natural rather than forced.

## Philosophy

- **100% Free**: No ads, no subscriptions, no premium features
- **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally on your device or encrypted on your terms. Nothing tracked, nothing stored server-side without your control.
- **Judgment-Free**: See your patterns without labels, shame, or fear-mongering
- **Awareness-First**: Understanding your habits is the first step to changing them
