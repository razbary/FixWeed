# FixWeed Project Rules

## Core Principles
- **Complete User Anonymity**: No user data stored server-side, nothing exposed to the host
- **Zero Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or tracking of any kind
- **Client-Side First**: All user progress/data stored locally (localStorage, IndexedDB)
- **Privacy by Design**: If cloud sync is needed, use client-side encryption where user controls the key

## Architecture Restrictions
- No server-side user databases
- No session tracking or cookies
- No analytics or telemetry services
- All user state must be client-side only

## Code Standards
- **Consistent Styling**: Check existing components/elements before creating new ones to maintain visual consistency across the app. Match established patterns unless explicitly asked to deviate.

## Design Standards
- **Brutalist Aesthetic**: Embrace "inefficient" but unique, cool designs—the site itself is an art statement
- **Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics**: No default LLM style suggestions (glitch/hacker, neon/cyberpunk, gradient blobs, etc.)
- **Niche Inspirations**: Draw from underground web design, 2000s aesthetics, winamp themes, brutalist
- **Uniqueness Over Efficiency**: Prioritize distinctive visual experiences over conventional UX patterns
- **Small/Inspired Sources**: Reference smaller, more experimental web design rather than mainstream trends
- **Break Convention**: Use shapes/objects for unrelated purposes, challenge typical web design rules when it serves the aesthetic 

## Design Idea Bank (draw from as needed, not required)
- Asymmetry, off-center layouts, raw HTML feel
- Retro web artifacts: visible compression, JPEG artifacts, digital imperfections
- Stacked/overlapping panels instead of unified containers
- Beveled buttons, inset effects, physically-depressed elements
- Metallic/chrome/translucent surfaces with glossy textures
- Non-standard navigation patterns
- Heavy borders, deep shadows, inset panels
- Limited high-saturation accent colors for active states
- Condensed sans-serif (ALL CAPS) + monospace typography mix
- Instant color transitions (no smooth animations)
- Digital noise/grain filters, text marquees
- "Crunchy" high-contrast blur effects
- Custom chunky scrollbars as design elements
- Visible grid textures, intentional clutter 

## Prohibited Actions
- Storing user data on the server
- Exposing user information to the host
- Implementing analytics or tracking
- Using third-party services that collect user data

## Required Patterns
- Client-side storage for all user progress (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- If sync is needed: client-side encryption with user-controlled keys

## Workflow Preferences
