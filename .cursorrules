# FixWeed Project Rules

## Core Principles
- **Complete User Anonymity**: No user data stored server-side, nothing exposed to the host
- **Zero Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or tracking of any kind
- **Client-Side First**: All user progress/data stored locally (localStorage, IndexedDB)
- **Privacy by Design**: If cloud sync is needed, use client-side encryption where user controls the key

## Architecture Restrictions
- No server-side user databases
- No session tracking or cookies
- No analytics or telemetry services
- All user state must be client-side only

## Code Standards
- 

## Prohibited Actions
- Storing user data on the server
- Exposing user information to the host
- Implementing analytics or tracking
- Using third-party services that collect user data

## Required Patterns
- Client-side storage for all user progress (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- If sync is needed: client-side encryption with user-controlled keys

## Workflow Preferences
